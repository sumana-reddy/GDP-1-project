# Northwest Gaming Appplication

## Project Charter

This is the project charter for the Northwest Gaming Application. This Application will be developed as a Progressive Web application.

## Project Purpose:
This is a mobile gaming application which enables the players(users of this game) to complete a quest which is finding out specific set of location based on the clues provided. This is a fun game aimed at involving the students at Northwest Missouri State University to make their respective teams and participate in the competition to score maximum points based on the level of the difficulty. As we all know due to the ongoing pandemic it is really difficult to get together a group of people but this game will provide the paltform to get along  and meeting new people while still maintaining the social distancing. This also helps the students in improving the mental and physical fitness as the clues will be tricky a person has to walk/jog/run(depends on the interest of the person) to these locations.
